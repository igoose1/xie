I was exploring China with Tzeyu during winter holidays, visited Sichuan. And
you know, I think if not firewall China could be easily competing with other
Asian hubs of digital nomads!

I'll write from a perspective of living in Chengdu but some details will be the
same for other [New Tier 1 cities][new-tier-1].

[new-tier-1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system

## Big problems

1. **Internet:** it's very bad and VPN doesn't help much.
2. **Language barrier:** not worse than Vietnamese one if you consider
   non-touristic cities, online translator helps to talk in-person, in
   restaurants you order with an app which has a built-in translator.
3. **Authoritarianism and world's heaviest restrictions against freedoms:** same as
   in Vietnam---another popular digital nomad hub,---okay, this topic is
   controversial but what can't be controversial is that it doesn't affect a
   nomad.
4. **No bidet shower:** ah god, previous century problems.

## But

1. **Low prices on food:** local dish can cost $2, we've been to a temple's
   vegetarian buffet restaurant with a price of $4.5 per entry, a European dish
   can cost $10.
2. **Low prices on accommodation:** we were renting a room 5 minutes away from
   the subway for $15 per night but that could be an anomaly.
3. **Developed public transport:** not like Bangkok, even more developed!
   Subway and buses are cheaper than half of the dollar, taxi costs like the
   one in Bangkok, bicycle rental is $0.5 per hour at every corner, speed
   trains to other cities are convenient, well, speedy, and affordable.
4. **Developed logistics:** food delivery arrives in 10 minutes, they delivered
   a cable from another part of the country in 2 days (I paid $0.5 for
   everything including the cable), in grocery stores there's food from the
   whole country, and you can find Russian seafood and South East Asian fruit.
5. **Developed EVERYTHING:** maps apps show a traffic light timer and compare
   prices of different taxi providers, payment can be done by QR, NFC or hand
   palm. Everything is from the 22nd century except the bidet shower, ah god.
6. **Much entertainment, many gyms, easy to build new hobbies:** but need to
   overcome the language barrier.

Internet spoils everything. If not the Internet, we'd be in China right now probably :-)
