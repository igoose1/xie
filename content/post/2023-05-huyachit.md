There's a Russian word "huyachit". It's a curse word that you can't use it near Russian
serious people. Part of it refers to male genitals, as is often the case.

The word means "to work hard". Very hard. You would say the student huyachil (a past tense
of huyatchit), if he/she got all A's or 100% marks. In China, they huyachit with a 9-9-6
schedule. Silicon Valley founders huyachit before their brains and bodies burn out.
