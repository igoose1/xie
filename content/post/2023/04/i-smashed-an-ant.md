I smashed an ant. And nothing happened.

I was a child when I saw the ruined life of an ant. Probably that was the ant. Probably
that ant was an with a well-organized colony. Perhaps the ant had a family and a past, but
now its future was cut short. You saw the body; soon it'd decompose leaving memories
and a bridge built from twigs.

The brain was crushed, the heart no longer beats. You can think about any kind of
afterlife but the reality is that ant's own self doesn't exist anymore.

Have a look at your local average life expectancy numbers, adjust an age by your lifestyle
and habits... And think. Do you believe that you will be remembered for your
accomplishments? And after all, was the ant worried about its own legacy?
