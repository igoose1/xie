I wanted to write a blog post about Malaysian fuel prices. RON95 petrol and diesel are
subsidised by the government. Compare these graphs.

#### Diesel price per litre, in ringgits
![](diesel.webp "Diesel price graph")

#### RON95 petrol price per litre, in ringgits
![](ron95.webp "RON95 petrol price graph")

#### RON97 petrol price per litre, in ringgits
![](ron97.webp "RON97 price graph")

These subsidies are also a reason why it's illegal to fuel a car with RON95 if you're a
foreigner.

Did you like the graphs above?

This data and these graphs are provided by the [OpenDOSM project][opendosm]. DOSM is
Department of Statistics Malaysia. The website is a collection of DOSM's data published by
Creative Commons licenses. [Frontend and Backend repositories][github] are also published
as Free Software!

And I like it. Researchers are funded by taxpayers. Taxpayers get their data freely.
