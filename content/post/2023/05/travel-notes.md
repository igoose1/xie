Last days I'm helping in searching of a missing Russian girl. I don't want to describe
that story a lot as it's midnight already, I wrote more messages and letters than I wrote
in a month. and I'm very tired. So TS;RTI (too short; read that instead) is here:
[reddit][reddit], [notion with well-structured but Russian info][notion].

The main reason I'm writing that post is that the girl didn't share with her plans.
We still can't understand if that was a kidnapping or if she wanted to be lost herself but
let's assume that current situation is unexpected even for her. Volunteers found all her
friends, we work with her mother, we work with her international friends, we work with
strangers from other countries... And no one, including close friends and relatives, knows
where she planned to stay.

I travel much. I change accommodation more often than I update a toothpaste. And I got
used to it. I don't share my locations with relatives, I get new SIM cards and don't tell
anyone about my new phone numbers.

And this is wrong. One day I could be seized and my close people will spend many days just
to confirm where I was and where I wanted to go. I'll try to fix that point soon.

Btw, I have https://nomadlist.com/@oskars where everyone can track me. I try to update it
frequently and it's almost always valid.
