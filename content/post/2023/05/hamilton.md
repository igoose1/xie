That's a musical about revolution and American founding father Alexander Hamilton. Don't
close this blog post if you haven't attended a musical before! This one is special. It
tells the story with hip-hop and rap, and mixes R&B with classic Broadway tunes.

The story narrates about Hamilton's journey from his humble beginnings as an orphan in the
Caribbean, to his arrival in New York City as a young immigrant, to his rise as one of the
most influential figures in American history.

I first found out about "Hamilton" at the Summer Computer School. Andrew Garkavy, a
teacher in those years, arranged several evenings of viewing recordings of the musical. At
the time, recordings were in low quality, distributed by volunteers, and Garkavy was one
of the Torrent peer of subtitles in Russian. But in 2020 [Disney released][disney] the
film version: now you can watch the musical in such a wonderful picture and with such a
delightful sound, as you were sitting in front of the stage yourself. I watched it more
than 3 times with people I'm proud of, with whom I respect and I love.

And I highly recommend that you take a night out to see it.
