It's believed, that if we have a problem, we search for a solution to it. Unfortunately,
sometimes Homo sapiens do that in reverse order: they have an idea, want to release it but
search for a problem to have an excuse.

I see it among amateur programmers.

## New coders learned to use a hammer (any technology) and they **invent** nails

That's a great way to learn: if you need to handle a technology, you need to practice with
that. However, you can see the same pattern in a life.

## People can forget their real aims and stick to an idea

A perfect example is blogging. I started new blogs many times, I used to program blog
engines in Django, used to used static generators, used to try services and after a while
I got an instrument for writing posts and didn't have motivation to use it. The last time
I started a Russian [weekly], I told myself, "You're going to spend an hour to configure
everything and not more". And that worked. I'm sure I spent more time on completing it
with content than burnishing a tool.

Another example can be note taking. I know friends who learned about Zettelkasten, set up
their Obsidian and Notion, but didn't write a decent number of notes. I was the
[same][zt-web], but eventually forced myself to write in plain files, using few-line
scripts. Later I coded a [tool][gozt] to replace these scripts, and suppressed my
Zettelkasten.

The moral is to be honest with yourself.

## If you want to start doing something, go and do that. Don't spend time on preparation

If you want to start a blog, press few buttons in Wordpress and **write a blog**. If you
want to code another blog platform, configure deployment and CDNs, don't lie to yourself.
