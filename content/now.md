We're in Bali! Even though I lived in Southeast Asia for 2.5 years, this is my
first time being in Indonesia. We spent February in the sinking capital,
Jakarta, and now came to the "Island of the Gods".

Our first 1.5 weeks were in Seminyak area, it's a beach town full of fancy restaurants
with high prices and blend food. Tzeyu arrived a bit later, and while she was doing her
little solo-trip in Yogyakarta (she drove a bike to an active volcano!), I had time to
taste all shawermas in the area. But I digress.

Later we moved to a cozy room in Kuta. They have smoothie in the kitchen, and 90% of my
last meals were full of vegetables and fruits. Mum, be proud!

We tried surfing! Now it's our main sport because there aren't many good
climbing gyms nearby. Surfing isn't that flexible, we can't go to the sea any
time we get free. There are different tides and we aren't ready yet for any
tides so usually the sea has 4 "perfect" hours per day when we can enjoy its
waves... And these hours start early in the morning. I'm already used to waking
up after 6 hours of sleep to get hit by the salty water, get sunburn and "nap"
for 2 more hours before work. What a wonderful life!

We launched and already abandoned SendGlitter.my with Tzeyu. It was a small
e-commerce web-site with "Stupid Glitter Letter" product. It was a fun
experience of making a fancy e-com site but we couldn't keep it going from
another country.

I study Chinese harder than before but it never becomes easy. Writing is my
Achilles' heel. I grind it with
[anki-maobi](https://github.com/jcklie/anki-maobi), and I really like this
add-on but Chinese characters just don't stick in my memory. For vocabulary, I
add words from my lessons with the tutor and this works good. Usually I can
utilise vocabulary from the last lesson, unless it's a
classifier-for-objects-with-a-top-such-as-hats. I hate you, é¡¶.

Recenlty I grind a lot of Geoguessr metas. I've organized a few Geoguessr
parties in vas3k.club community, and soon we are having a local tournament. I
don't want to loose so now I now the difference between electricity poles in
Thailand and in Philippines. Let's gooo!

That's all for now!
