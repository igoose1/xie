I'm in Penang with Tzeyu. This time we rented an apartment for a month and I
don't need to move between hotel rooms!

I got excited about rock climbing from vas3k.club posts and some talks with
friends so this month we gave a try to a "Project Rock" gym. They gave us a
two-week membership and we climb their walls 5--6 days per week. Bouldering
turned out to be a very fun and smart activity, and takes all of our evening
energy!

This month we work much from cafes and I wrote a blog-post [about it in
Russian][cafes].

Except work and climbing, I'm coding my small Go cli app for time tracking.
I've been using [chrono][chrono] for a few years but the author doesn't update
it and there're features I want to be built in another way. I'd considered
forking a project but later realized I'd like to change core ideas radically.

Next month I'd like to stay in Penang too but I didn't find an accommodation
yet. Also, I don't know where I'll be on July. If an immigration center accepts
my visa extension request, I'd like to spend another month in Malaysia. If not,
I'll go to Vietnam for 2--3 months.

This is my first now page. Let's hope this idea goes far! It would be perfect
if I find a simple way to save old now pages and serve them in RSS so friends
can subscribe to updates.
