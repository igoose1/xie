My last update was more than a month ago and I shared I was about to go to China. Chinese
trip is complete! I stayed one day in Guangzhou, a week in Beijing and one day in Hong
Kong, and I had much joy. I had planned to make a short trip somewhere near Beijing but
the capital surprised me with its infrastructure so much I decided to stay there more. I
had many awkward and funny attempts of speaking my very limited Mandarin.
List of achievements I'm proud consist of:

1. had Chinese food in places where they have no English menu every day,
2. bought 3 peaches, 0.5 kg of nectarines, and some other fruits I can't recall
   at small stores,
3. had 3 hawthorn tanghulu,
4. rented bicycle 8 times,
5. climbed twice in the local climbing gym,
6. learned mini-apps for searching restaurant reviews and ordering food
   delivery.

I'm a simple person, simple things make me happy.

Having a day in Hong Kong was a great idea too. It is my favourite place in the
world and every trip I explore new pieces of it. This time I visited The Peak.
I've also tasted the best xiaolongbao in my life but it's not Cantonese and I'm
even a bit shy to mention it.

Now me and Tzeyu are in the southern Thailand. We don't want to stay here very
long but we have to because I'm applying for one specific visa. That
application is processing for many more months than we expected and it drains
and limits us in movement but we don't have much choice.

Last days are chill. We found different boards of Ticket to Ride (Europe, US,
Berlin) and played over 5 games already.

I keep studying Chinese. I gave up on writing and focused on vocabulary.
Currently my Anki deck has 1200 cards. I do at least 20 minutes of grinding per
day. It's not much but it's better than nothing!

I'd organized a few Geoguessr parties in [vas3k.club](https://vas3k.club)
community, and these occasional meetings led to a Geoguessr community of 100+
members, a few small tournaments, and non-stop dicsussions of road poles.
That's great!
