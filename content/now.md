Me and Tzeyu are in Kuala Lumpur. Finally! This had to happen a few months earlier but
life isn't for sissies.

I haven't updated this page for 2 months. Weeks were a bit chaotic and my geolocation,
mood and plans for the year depended on Malaysia's immigration department. Eventually, I
obtained the longest visa I've ever had. We plan is to slow down with travelling for a
year --- or more, who knows --- and build a base in Kuala Lumpur.

Right now I'm sitting in the living room of Tzeyu's relative. They were kind enough to
host us while we are signing a long-term rental contract. I'm lucky being here and I never
thought I could stay as comfortable as here. Although, my productivity still dropped and I
usually spent more time on choosing the right song for working than actually working. No
wonder I'm updating my now page at 1 am instead of preparing to sleep...

I've been to Kuala Lumpur before but it was a while ago when I only started my nomad life.
I was immature and wasn't too excited in exploring places. This time, I had an evening
when everyone in the house but me had their plans. I decided to visit some known places in
the center and then just walk until I get tired. That was a long walk, I listened podcasts
about China, saw the second tallest building in the world, I saw the tallest twin towers
in the world... And that shouldn't have even sounded exciting, that's not hard at all to
see these buildings being in the city!

Because of crazy travellings, we didn't do any sports for weeks. This Sunday we finally
managed to get to the climbing gym. That's an achievement too.

I think I may stop with this sentence. That's good enough.
