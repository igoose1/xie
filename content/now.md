I'm still in Penang with Tzeyu! But tomorrow I'll be in Kuala Lumpur, then in
Tashkent, and at last in Astana. At the end of this page you can find my
locations with dates when I'm moving.

Now all my thoughts are about the upcoming trip. I hope I won't leave anything
in SE Asia because I don't know how soon I'll come back.

We climbed in Penang twice--thrice per week, and it's still exciting! We even
invited a few friends and family members to the gym. I'm going to take climbing
shoes to my trip and excited to try out gyms in KL and Kazakhstan too!

Last week we were hosting a friend of the friend at our apartment. That was
another unusual experience to us, and, to be honest, very tiring one too. We
had gotten used to having our own private space where we can hide from talking,
and last days that wasn't possible. The day after our guest left, my body
declared its resignation with a fever. Now I'm alright, thanks for asking!

If you plan to meet me somewhere in Central Asia, please, warn me in advance. I
will need some time to recharge a social battery.

Also, I started to learn Chinese! I have a wonderful teacher, and now I can type funny
misspelled phrases to Tzeyu. 很了不起！
