We're in Hanoi, Vietnam! This is one of my favorite cities in Southeast
Asia---I have weird standards---and I'm happy to be here with Tzeyu! I already
showed her my favorite Bánh mì (a sandwich with amazing baguette), my favorite tea
house, and we ate liters of Phở---a soup with rice noodles usually beef.

Last month we spent in Bali. Even though I lived in Southeast Asia for 2.5
years, this was my first time being in Indonesia. There we tried surfing! It
wasn't that flexible, we couldn't go to the sea any time we got free. There are
different tides and we aren't ready yet for any tides so usually the sea has 4
"perfect" hours per day when we can enjoy its waves... And these hours start
early in the morning. So I had to get used[^1] to waking up after 6 hours of sleep to
get hit by the salty water, get sunburn and "nap" for 2 more hours before work.
What a wonderful life!

[^1]: Previous version of that sentence had "I'm already used to..." but I was wrong.

I'd organized a few Geoguessr parties in [vas3k.club](https://vas3k.club)
community, and these occasional parties led to a small tournament with 8 teams
and 36 members. The tournament has been running for 2 weeks already and is about to end.
It's full of fun and we learned a lot about organizing events with participants
across 10 time zones. As an organizer, I really hope this one ends soon; we
distribute prizes, have a good rest, and prepare for the new tournament with
longer deadlines---so nobody needs to risk their job to win our silly competition.

I keep studying Chinese but it never becomes easy. Writing is my Achilles'
heel. I grind it with [anki-maobi](https://github.com/jcklie/anki-maobi), and I
really like this add-on but Chinese characters just don't stick in my memory.
For vocabulary, I add words from my lessons with the tutor and this works good.
