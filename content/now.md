I'm in Bangkok with Tzeyu! We stayed here for a month and are leaving at the
beginning of January to Penang for Chinese New Year! I'm very excited.

Bangkok is pleasant. Temperature dropped to 20--30 deg C and we don't even use A/C at
night. This time we're renting a studio without kitchen. It's good for the
price of accommodation but it turns out bad for food prices because of the area. We're
in Thong Lo, this station has more Japanese food than local one and prices are 3 times
bigger than a local food price. Aaanyway, when would I try Okinawa soba if not
this location?

We climb 2.5 times per week! Although, our bouldering membership ends soon, and
we plan to do some "free climbing" before leaving the city.

My Chinese studying slowed down. I don't spend much time on it during the week and only
study before the class. I probably still can count some silly Chinese conversations with
Tzeyu but I don't learn anything new with them.

We started playing Geoguessr! I spent some night hours memorizing domains, flags and poles
but gave up soon. It's a fun game but its skills won't be much useful in real life. Great
players memorize meta-clues: camera quality, coverage years, and google-car roofs. That's
a bit lame.

Happy new year!
