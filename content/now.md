I'm in Penang with Tzeyu. We had rented an apartment for May, and now we're
about to rent another one for June.

We do climbing less frequently than two weeks ago because we figured out our
muscles can't rest in 24 hours. Now we try to go 3--4 times per week and it's
still exciting! We even bought special shoes for our activity and now we don't
need to rent them from the gym.

I wanted to spend my spare time coding a small Go cli app for time tracking.
I'm using [chrono][chrono] for a few years but the author doesn't update it and
there're features I want to be built in another way. However, now I got
distracted by functional programming and Phoenix Framework. It's a new paradigm
of building software for me and I'm trying new things like a new-born blind
puppy.

In a few days we will try to extend my visa. If they approve my request, I
could stay in Malaysia until July. And after Malaysia I'm flying to Kazakhstan.

This is my second now page. I didn't forget about it! Tzeyu also started her
web-blog and I wish she continues filling it with her thoughts:
