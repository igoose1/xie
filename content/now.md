We already spent 2.5 months in Kuala Lumpur. This is probably the longest stay
in one city I had for years! Our apartment gets cozier and messier, roads are
getting memorized and habits are being built. Sometimes there are wrong habits
(we often misspress the elevator button the same way), sometimes they are good
(I jog!). I love our new home!

We bouldered and climbed the top rope until these days. Last weeks were a bit
busy for Tzeyu so sometimes I climbed without her and sometimes we just
skipped. Now our membership expired and we decided to not extend until we come
back from our small journey in January.

I'm not that sad about skipping climbing because I started to jog. I choose the
same trail, mostly jogging at night. This doesn't take much time---now I only
run for 15 minutes without breaks---and I don't track how fast and how much I
run---my watch can only show time, run stopwatch and beep in mornings---but
these jogs make me happy and I'm even proud I do them. I don't care what method
is the most efficient and what pulse I'm running with, and maybe that's one of
the reason I'm happy :-)

In the last month we hosted many people! I can even go further and say most of
the month our house was occupied with guests. We hosted a couple of friends of
mine, a couple of friends of Tzeyu's and a relative. Hosting isn't difficult if
we don't break the routine and guests know how to entertain themselves.
Moreover, guests bring parts of their lives into ours, and it's a good way to
learn something new about things I never thought of. As an example, now I
constantly make my own yogurt in the thermos (wait, it was always a brand
name!?), and that was something I learned from a friend staying at our place.

We are going to Sichuan during New Year holidays. I'm very excited with
itinerary we collectively composed! It includes two big and unique cities
(Chongqing and Chengdu) and outskirts in mountains. And horses. I hope we use a
chance to ride the horses!

This year I organized a Secret Santa for vas3k.club. We had less participants
due the changes in eligibility criteria. We reduced a number of inactive club
members, and I'm 100% sure that was a correct move.

The end! See you whenever I recall this page again, haha.
