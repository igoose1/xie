We are in Almaty with Tzeyu! This city has a post-Soviet vibe and mountain
views from rented apartments, and I like it much more than Astana, de jure capital
of Kazakhstan.

I met my family for the first time in years! My parents' hair turned grey, my
younger sister is becoming independent. They finally talked with Tzeyu in person and
became friends. We played "Ticket to Ride" almost daily, and now I can call
myself a professional winner üòé

We climb in Almaty twice per week. Here they have a small, usually overcrowded,
but still challenging and fun bouldering gym. I even bought new shoe pair to
replace the lost ones. When I have a reason, I always invite new friends to the gym, and
usually they love it! (And hate the next day when muscles hurt.)

On weekends we hope to hike in mountains, and the next week Tzeyu is leaving
home. I'll stay in Central Asia for a while, and then move to SE Asia too. I
plan to celebrate my birthday (21 October) in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Before it,
I'd like to cross crazy traffics in Hanoi and swim in a sea of Da Nang in
Vietnam.

Also, I started to learn Chinese! I have a wonderful teacher, and now I can type funny
misspelled phrases to Tzeyu. Âæà‰∫Ü‰∏çËµ∑ÔºÅ
