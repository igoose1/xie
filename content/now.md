Me and Tzeyu are in Kuala Lumpur. Finally! We plan to stay here for a year, maybe with
short trips in Asia.

We rented a nice apartment. Since moving in, we were busy making it cozy. Now we have an
air fryer so I believe we accomplished the goal.

Additionally, I've finally bought Raspberry Pi. I dreamed about it when I was studying,
and I couldn't buy it because I didn't money for it... And then after starting to work I
didn't have a need. After moving in I made up a reason and purchased Raspberry Pi with a
SATA hat. Now this is our home NAS, home torrent seeder and home Minecraft server. Happy!

We climb. We did 2 climbs per week trying to increase it to 3 climbs. And this is hard! If
I climbed on Monday, I can't climb productively on Wednesday. I'll see if I can do other
exercises---thankfully our climbing gym has different gym equipment, weights, pull-up
bars and hangboards. If this won't be productive either, maybe we can alter days every
week.

I'm busy with making a Secret Santa tool for communities. I've organised Secret Santa for
600 members of vas3k.club in previous years. This year I'd like to offer the same for
other small communities I'm part of.
