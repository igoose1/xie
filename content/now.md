I'm in Penang with Tzeyu. We've rented the second apartment for June and it's
much more pleasant than living in hotels. For example, it comes with a perk I
didn't consider before. We let a friend's friend stay at our place for a night!
If you need to visit an island, we're hosting!

We climb thrice per week and it's still exciting! Our gym was closed for a few days
because of national competitions but now it's open back with new routes!

I wanted to spend my spare time coding a small Go cli app for time tracking.
I'm using [chrono][chrono] for a few years but the author doesn't update it and
there're features I want to be built in another way. However, now my priorities
changed and I got distracted by functional programming and Phoenix Framework.
It's a new paradigm of building software for me and I'm trying new things like
a new-born blind puppy.

We extended my visit pass and now I can stay in Malaysia a little bit longer.
That was a long fun quest of getting these 4 allowed months, and I'm unique
with all factors I had. Probably, I should I write a post about getting a
social visa as a Russian nomad in SEAsia.

At the beginning of August I'm flying to Kazakhstan to meet my family. I spent
much time searching for an interesting stopover and now my journey includes 21
hours in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. I wanted to visit this country for a long time,
but I didn't know they have a "chillya", the hottest period of the year. In that days
the temperature can be over 40 &deg;C ðŸ¤¯

Tzeyu also started her web-blog and I STILL wish she continues filling it with her
