Heyy! This is the first now page in 2026. I've missed an update in January but
who reads these anyways? :-)

Chinese New Year is coming and this means I and Tzeyu are going to Penang.
Actually she's already there and I'm going tomorrow but I'm already excited to
visit my favourite restaurants and hikes.

This week I'm spending alone. I was very excited with one project and put much
effort into it at the beginning of the week. My sleeping pattern broke without
Tzeyu but I think it's because I couldn't care less. I'd rather use my
motivation to work for 10 hours straight than waste my Muse on sleeping. And
that "paid back". I had been overproductive and then got overlazy. Smart books
say it's better to be constant, and I agree, but I can't always follow it.

I also explored the area around. Our house is great... If you have a car. I
don't have one and I was sure there's nothing fun if you don't take a
transport. Yesterday I walked much, explored shortcuts and parks around, and I
ensured we chose an amazing location for our long-term apartment.

I'm not happy with my current sports situation. I had big goals for 2026 and
I'm behind the schedule. Same problem with my languages. I don't want to talk
much about it because I believe sharing goals is worse then hiding them:

My last now-page was about my upcoming trip to Sichuan so I feel like I have to
say something China in this one. China was great!

See you next time!
