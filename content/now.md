We're in Penang! This is a hometown of Tzeyu, and we have to be here during Chinese New
Year or her whole family will hate us. I don't mind, I like the place and the family, and
Chinese New Year is another reason to prolong holidays!

For the first time, we are renting a whole house! I don't even understand a
chain of friends which leaded to us getting this place for a month, but I'm
very happy. Short-term rent of apartments is always a challenge, and I don't even want to
share how many hours were spent on exploring and negotiating options...

Now we have our own garage and a small garden. Although, house isn't perfect---city air is
burning and we miss an aircon in the living room.

For climbing, we visit our favourite gym where that's all started! Some locals even
recognized us and were happy to chat when we came back half of the year later!

We launched SendGlitter.my with Tzeyu. It's a small e-commerce web-site with
"Stupid Glitter Letter" product. Not sure what to do with it and customers when we leave
Malaysia, and we're about to leave Malaysia already... However, it was a fun experience
of making a fancy e-com site. I'm not even ashamed of its design.

I study Chinese vocabulary daily. It became easier after setting up Anki and adding my own
cards. Also, I installed a "4000 Essential English Words" deck, and study it
for 10 minutes every day. There're so many short English words which I didn't even know!

After a New Year, we decided to go to Jakarta. All around the net says to avoid this
dense, polluted and sinking city, which makes me even more excited about the
trip! Imagine, if we go to the coast, we could be last humans stepping on some
rocks before that part of the city drowns! Anyway, I need to double-check my
stash of masks.

Happy New Year again! üçä
