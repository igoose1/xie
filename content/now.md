We're in Bali! Even though I lived in Southeast Asia for 2.5 years, this is my
first time being in Indonesia. We spent February in the sinking capital,
Jakarta, and now came to the "Island of the Gods".

Our accommodation isn't any good because we hadn't decided a region where we
stay in advance. Tzeyu wanted to do a short solo-trip at the beginning of this
month and I planned to go to South Bali to try surfing for the first time in my
life. Later, I'd go to Central Bali and see why Ubud is so famous among nomads.
However, Tzeyu's trip was tougher and shorter than we expected so she came to
me earlier and now we are stuck in Seminyak.

Although, we don't complain much about staying in a beach town! We both tried
surfing and it's a wonderful substitution to bouldering. I had about 6 hours
with the board already and I see some progress every time I enter the water.
Tzeyu has a lot of fun with waves too so we marked this Bali trip as a month of
surfing.

We launched and already abandoned SendGlitter.my with Tzeyu. It was a small
e-commerce web-site with "Stupid Glitter Letter" product. It was a fun
experience of making a fancy e-com site but we couldn't keep it going from
another country.

I study Chinese harder than before but it never becomes easy. Writing is my
Achilles' heel. I grind it with
[anki-maobi](https://github.com/jcklie/anki-maobi), and I really like this
add-on but Chinese characters just don't stick in my memory. For vocabulary, I
add words from my lessons with the tutor and this works good. Usually I can
utilise vocabulary from the last lesson, unless it's a
classifier-for-objects-with-a-top-such-as-hats. I hate you, é¡¶.

That's all for now!
