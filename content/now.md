These are my last days in Hanoi. We stayed here for almost two months, eating
liters of Pho and even more Banh mi sandwiches. My final conclusion is that
Hanoi can be the best city in South East Asia if only it fixes its air and
noise pollution problems. We had to top up our stash of face masks and earplugs
here.

This was the first time we booked a motorbike for months. Our own vehicle
improved the quality of life significantly. We could do many things outdoor
without interruptions, such as visiting favorite dining places before a cafe
and then going to a grocery store, and pharmacy, and oh Tzeyu can you please
drop me here I want to buy some milk tea for climbing. Ah, milk tea!

Tzeyu left earlier. She went to Korea, and we will reunion[^1] in a few weeks
in Malaysia or nearby. Until that I have an important mission. I'm going to
China and I have to use as much vocabulary as I could remember in the last
months. I don't really have many ideas what I'm going to do in China. For now,
I know for sure that I'm going to order a lot of meals, pastries, and drinks,
but probably I need to find more things to do. As I understood, Chinese tourism
didn't fully recover from Covid. It's hard to find updated information in
English as soon as I search for something weirder than Palace Museum, Tiananmen
Square, and the Great Wall. For example, I still don't know if there's any good
climbing gym in Beijing! There definitely must be a few, it's just hard to
find.

[^1]: Not to be confused with a French island near Madagascar.

Here, in Hanoi, I climbed twice per week without skipping, and I don't want to
break my personal streak even on a "vacation". And as I started talking about
sports, it's probably an ideal paragraph to mention that we tried Lindy Hop
dancing courses. I wasn't good and it was stressing for me but I know Tzeyu
enjoyed it a lot, and this matters.

I keep studying Chinese but it doesn't become easier. I gave up studying
writing and focused on vocabulary. Currently my Anki deck has 1200 cards. I do
at least 20 minutes of grinding per day stably... And it's not enough. I can
see progress but Anki was never a suitable tool to show how good you are, its
algorithms are meant to always push you into unknown territory. I hope my
adventures in China will show my studying is worth something. If my
"能便宜一点儿吗？" (can be a bit cheaper?) works at least once, I will be the
happiest tourist in the country.

I'd organized a few Geoguessr parties in [vas3k.club](https://vas3k.club)
community, and these occasional meetings led to a Geoguessr community of 100+
members, a few small tournaments, and non-stop dicsussions of road poles.
That's great!
